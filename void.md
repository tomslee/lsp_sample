## From "A Void"

Today, by radio, and also on giant hoardings, a rabbi, an admiral notorious for
his links to Masonry, a trio of cardinals, a trio, too, of insignificant
politicians (bought and paid for by a rich and corrupt Anglo-Canadian banking
corporation), inform us all of how our country now risks dying of starvation.
A rumour, that's my initial thought as I switch off my radio, a rumour or
possibly a hoax. Propaganda, I murmur anxiously -- as though, just by saying so,
I might allay my doubts -- typical politicians' propaganda. But public opinion
gradually absorbs it as a fact.


- Paragraph #1 from "A Void"

Noon rings out. A wasp, making an ominous sound, a sound akin to a klaxon or
a tocsin, flits about. Augustus, who has had a bad night, sits up blinking and
purblind. Oh what was that word (is his thought) that ran through my brain all
night, that idiotic word that, hard as I'd try to pin it down, was always just
an inch or two out of my grasp - fowl or foul or Vow or Voyal? - a word which,
by association, brought into play an incongruous mass and magma of nouns,
idioms, slogans and sayings, a confusing, amorphous outpouring which I sought
in vain to control or turn off but which wound around my mind a whirlwind of
a cord, a whiplash of a cord, a cord that would split again and again, would
knit again and again, of words without communication or any possibility of
combination, words without pronunciation, signification or transcription but
out of which, notwithstanding, was brought forth a flux, a continuous, compact
and lucid flow: an intuition, a vacillating frisson of illumination as if
caught in a flash of lightning or in a mist abruptly rising to unshroud an
obvious sign - but a sign, alas, that would last an instant only to vanish for
good.
