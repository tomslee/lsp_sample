# A minimal Language Server Protocol demo

This shows how to build an absurdly simplistic language server, consumed by vim using an LSP client plugin.

The language server is called on text files. Called "efree" it flags an error wherever it finds the character lowercase "e" in the document. The vim plugin responds to these errors by highlighting the occurrences of the letter "e" wherever it occurs.
